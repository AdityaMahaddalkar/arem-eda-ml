# arem-eda-ml
A POC in R Language to perform Exploratory Data Analysis and select the best Machine Learning models for time series dataset AReM.

- The dataset can be found at [UCI Dataset Archive](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/366/activity+recognition+system+based+on+multisensor+data+fusion+arem)
- The dataset on the website is not clean. However, I have cleaned the data in this repository
